## TECO-64 - Command Errors

<style>
    span {
        white-space: nowrap;

</style>

If TECO is unable to execute a command, either because of a syntax,
system, or other error, it aborts execution of the command, prints an
error message, ignores all following commands, resets its state, and
prints its prompt to indicate that the user can enter new commands.

All error messages are of the form:

?XXX *message*

where XXX is an error code and *message* is a description of the error.
Depending on the setting of the EH flag, more information may also be
printed.

Some messages mention a specific character or string of characters
associated with the error. In these error messages, TECO represents
any non-printing special characters as described [here](conventions.md).

The following error messages are listed alphabetically by their three-letter
code.

| Error | Message            | Description |

| <span>?OFO</span> | <span>Output file already open</span> | A command has been executed which tried to create an output file, but an output file currently is open. It is typically appropriate to use the EC or EK command as the situation calls for to close the output file. |
| <span>?PDO</span> | <span>Push-down list overflow</span> | The command string has become too complex. Simplify it. |
| <span>?POP</span> | <span>Attempt to move pointer off page with '*x*'</span> | A J, C or R command has been executed which attempted to move the pointer off the page.

| <span>?SRH</span> | <span>Search failure: 'foo'</span> | A search command not preceded by a colon modifier and not within an iteration has failed to find the specified " command. After an S search fails the pointer is left at the beginning of the buffer. After an N or _ search fails the last page of the input file has been input and, in the case of N, output, and the buffer is cleared. In the case of an N search it is usually necessary to close the output file and reopen it. |

| <span>?UTC</span> | <span>Unterminated command string</span> | This is a general error which is usually caused by an unterminated insert, search, or filename argument, an unterminated \^A message, an unterminated tag or comment (i.e., unterminated ! construct), or a missing ' character which closes a conditional execution command. |
| <span>?UTM</span> | <span>Unterminated macro</span> | This error is that same as the ?UTC error except that the unterminated command was executing from a Q-register (i.e., it was a macro). (Note: An entire command sequence stored in a Q-register must be complete within the Q-register.) |
| <span>?XAB</span> | <span>Execution aborted</span> | Execution of TECO was aborted. This is usually due to the typing of <CTRL/C>. |
| <span>?YCA</span> | <span>Y command aborted</span> | An attempt has been made to execute a Y or _ search command with an output file open, that would cause text in the edit buffer to be erased without outputting it to the output file. The ED command controls this check. |
