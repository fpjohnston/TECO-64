## TECO-64 Internals Notes

### Overview

This document is a work in progress. It provides a description of the
design of TECO-64 for the benefit of those who maintain or enhance it,
as well as those who are curious about how it is structured.

### History

TECO-64 development began in October 2019, and was primarily done on Linux
(Ubuntu), using gcc and other GNU tools. It has been successfully executed
on Linux, Windows 10, and MacOS. It has also been successfully compiled
on VMS, but requires addititional run-time library support to be fully
executable.

### Development

The general guidelines used during development were:

- Familiarity – Use names that are either familiar to the reader
(e.g., with a Linux-like directory structure), or which are otherwise
descriptive of their purpose (e.g., er_cmd.c for a file which processes
the ER command).
- Consistency – Use the same conventions in one place that are used in
another (e.g., all functions which process specific commands having names
of the form exec_*()).
- Readability – Use names that can be pronounced (as opposed to an alphabet
soup of acronyms). And as much as possible, use names that include verbs
(e.g., reset_term() or clear_win()).
- Simplicity – Avoid long functions. Also avoid large files containing
numerous unrelated functions, and don’t duplicate code.
- Modularity – Hide details of functions and modules as much as possible.
This has made it possible to have more than one method for handling data
in the edit buffer, and more than one method for handling paging.

### Testing & Debugging

- *assert()* statements have been extensively used to verify assumptions
at run-time, especially regarding function parameters.
- PC-lint was used to verify correctness of code and detect possible bugs.
- Valgrind was used to detect memory leaks, as was some added debug code.
- *strace* was used to profile system calls.
- *uftrace* was used (in conjunction with *gprof*) to profile function and
library calls.
- *gdb* was used for debugging.
- The use of *assert()* statements, PC-lint, *gdb*, and *gprof* were
facilitated by makefile options.

### Documentation

- Doxygen comments were included to provide in-line documentation.
- XML and XSL files are used to create documentation as well as code
defining TECO command-line options.
- Markdown files were created for the README file, and to provide
release notes.

### Directory Names

- ./ - Contains the makefile used to build TECO, and the README.md file.
- ./bin - Contains the TECO-64 executable.
- ./doc - Contains Markdown documentation files.
- ./etc - Contains miscellaneous files used to build or document TECO,
including the XML file that defines the command-line options.
- ./html - Contains documentation files generated by Doxygen.
- ./include - Contains .h header files used for building TECO, including
one file, *_options.h*, that is generated during the build process.
- ./lib - Contains some TECO macro files.
- ./obj - Contains generated object files created during the build process.
- ./src - Contains the .c source files used to build TECO, and a configuration
file used by PC-Lint.

### File Names

- cmd_*.c - Files that perform general processing of TECO commands.
- *_cmd.c - Files that perform a specific TECO command (e.g., er_cmd.c
contains code for processing ER commands), or perform multiple related
TECO commands (e.g., yank_cmd.c contains code for processing commands
that yank data into memory).
- *_buf.c - Files that provide an interface for inserting, deleting,
reading, and writing text in the edit buffer. Only one of the following
is used in any specific build:
    - gap_buf.c – Implements a gap buffer.
    - rope_buf.c – Implements a rope buffer (TBD).
- page_*.c - Files that provide an interface for paging forward (and
possibly backward) through a file. Only one of the following is used
in any specific build:
    - page_file.c – Writes pages to output file, uses a temporary file
to allow for backwards paging (TBD).
    - page_std.c – Writes pages to output file; no backwards paging
implemented (classic TECO paging method).
    - page_vm.c – Writes pages to output file only when file is closed;
virtual memory is used to store pages, which allows for backwards paging.
- term_*.c - Files that process terminal input and output.
- *_sys.c - Files that provide interfaces to system-dependent features.
Code in all other files should be system-independent, but this is subject
to change during further testing.

### Function Names

- cmd_*() - Functions that perform general command processing.
- exec_*() - Functions that execute individual commands.
- *_ebuf() - Functions that provide an interface to the edit (or text) buffer.
- *_tbuf() - Functions that manipulate the terminal buffer.
- *_dpy() - Functions that manipulate the display window.
