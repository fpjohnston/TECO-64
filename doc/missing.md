## TECO-64 – Unimplemented Features

### Overview

Some features of other TECOs have not been included in this
version of TECO-64 for one or more of the following reasons:

- Implementation has been deferred to a future release.
- Implementation requires definition of how features should work in the supported operating environments.
- Implementation makes no sense for obsolete or irrelevant features.

### File Specification Switches

General command-line options for TECO are described in other
documentation, but no options for special file modes or file
formats have been implemented to specify such things as output
file cluster sizes, non-standard open modes, BASIC-PLUS-2 line
continuation, or FORTRAN carriage control.

### Unimplemented Commands

\^T - Read ASCII character
- :\^T - Reads and decodes the next keystroke typed at the terminal.
Note that only the colon-modified \^T command is unimplemented.
The colon-modified command is used to detect ESCape sequences.

ED - Edit Level Flag
- ED&4 - Expand memory as much as possible.
- ED&128 - Automatic refresh inhibit.

- :@EG/INI/ - Can be used to read the TECO_INIT environment variable,
but not to set or clear it.
- :@EG/LIB/ - Can be used to read the TECO_LIBRARY environment variable,
but not to set or clear it.
- :@EG/MEM/ - Can be used to read the TECO_MEMORY environment variable,
but not to set or clear it.
- :@EG/VTE/ - Can be used to read the TECO_VTEDIT environment variable,

W - Video Terminal Watch Commands

obsolete.
