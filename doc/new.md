## TECO-64 – New & Enhanced Features

This document describes the features that are either new to TECO-64,
or which have been copied or enhanced from earlier TECOs.

### General syntax changes

Whitespace may be used to make TECO-64 commands more readable. However,
unlike previous versions of TECO, whitespace may not occur within
anything considered a token, which includes digit strings and multi-character
commands such as ER or FS. Therefore, commands such as “1 2 3 =” are no longer
valid, and must instead be written as “123=” or “123 =”. Whitespace between
tokens is always valid.

Note that whitespace may now occur between a search or replace command
and any subsequent semi-colon command. Earlier versions of TECO required
that semi-colons immediately followed such commands, and printed a
NAS error if they did not. So the following are now valid:

    < @S/foo/ ; >

    < @FN/foo/baz/ ; >

If the E2&4 flag bit is set, an error will result if the following occurs:

- An at sign is used to modify a command that does not allow it.
- More than one at sign is used to modify a command.

If the E2&8 flag bit is set, an error will result if the following occurs:

- A colon is used to modify a command that does not allow it.
- A double colon is used to modify a command that does not allow it.
- More than two colons are used to modify a command.

Numeric expressions consist of either a single numeric value, called *n*, or
a pair of values, called *m* and *n*, separated by a comma. If a comma is seen,
then it must be preceded by an *m* argument, and must be followed by an *n*
argument. Multiple commas are not allowed.

Colons are allowed for all commands that open files, and will result in -1
being returned if the open succeeded, and 0 if it failed.
